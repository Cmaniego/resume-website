		<h2>Career Objective</h2>
		<h2 class="left">Main Objective</h2>
		<p class="left"> I hope to hone my skills as a web developer and work for companies in the video game industry or social media websites. Today's society relies heavily on social media for most aspects of life including getting a job so I hope to make a difference in that system or at least make an influence. As a Web Developer, I can also help small businesses have a polished and refined website to hopefully bring clients over to whatever they may sell. <br>
		<h2 class="left">Outside of Web Development</h2>
		<p class="left">In terms of other passions, I hope to polish my skills as an entertainer. Any programming skills will help me reach that goal and I believe Web Development will also help with marketing, so I want to pick up as many skills as I can in different fields.<br>
